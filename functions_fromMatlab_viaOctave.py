        @deftypefnx {Function File} {} @ imhmin (@var{im}, @var{h}, @var{conn})
        Caculate the morphological h-minimum transform of an image @var{im}.
    
        This function removes all regional minima in the grayscale image @var{im} whose depth
        is less or equal to the given threshold level @var{h}, and it increases the depth of
        the remaining regional minima by the value of @var{h}. (A "regional minimum" is
        defined as a connected component of pixels with an equal pixel value that is less
        than the value of all its neighboring pixels. And the "depth" of a regional minimum
        can be thought of as minimum pixel value difference between the regional minimum and
        its neighboring maxima.)
    
        The input image @var{im} needs to be a real and nonsparse numeric array (of any
        dimension), and the height parameter @var{h} a non-negative scalar number.
    
        The definition of "neighborhood" for this morphological operation can be set with the
        connectivity parameter @var{conn}, which defaults to 8 for 2D images, to 26 for 3D 
        images and to @code{conn(ndims(n), "maximal")} in general. @var{conn} can be given as
        scalar value or as a boolean matrix (see @code{conndef} for details).
    
        The output is a transformed grayscale image of same type and
        shape as the input image @var{im}.

        * The 'classical' reference for this morphological h-minimum function is the book
           "Morphological Image Analysis" by P. Soille (Springer, 2nd edition, 2004), chapter 
           6.3.4 "Extended and h-extrema".
           It says: "This [h-maximum] is achieved by performing the reconstruction by dilation
                         of [a grayscale image] f from f-h:
                         HMAX_h(f) = R^delta_f (f - h)
                [...]    The h-minima [...] transformations are defined by analogy:
                         HMIN_h(f) = R^epsilon_f (f + h)".
        * A more easily accessible reference is for example the following
           web page by RÃ©gis Clouard:
           https://clouard.users.greyc.fr/Pantheon/experiments/morphology/index-en.html#extremum
           It says: "It is defined as the [morphological] reconstruction by erosion
                         of [a grayscale image] f increased by a height h."
          (We will call the grayscale image im instead of f.)
